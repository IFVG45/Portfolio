        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>The objective of this project was to create cohesive marketing materials (and fundraising merchandise) for the Canadian Veterinarian Medical Association's annual Animal Health Week. This year the theme was Animal Welfare: Safeguarding the Five Animal Freedoms.
         This project was completed during my contract with Simzer Design, the key Project Manger was Matt Melvin.

        <h3>DISCOVERY AND TARGET AUDIENCE RESEARCH</h3>
          <p>The first phase in this project was a multitude of pencil sketches for the primary illustrative logo. As CVMA treats a multitude of types of animals, representation was pivotal.</p>

        <h3>DEFINE AND IDEATE</h3>
          <p>Art direction for this project had to appeal to a wide audience, from veterinarians to their clients, both farm animal owners and pet families. For this reason, I went with a bright, bold and family-friendly approach. My concept comprises of 5 animals, representing the diversity of the veterinariansâ€™ scope of care. Each animal in the logo corresponds to both a colour, and elsewhere in the campaign, one of the five freedoms.</p>

        <p>One of the first marketing pieced created, was an awareness poster. The objective of the poster was to inform veterinarian patients about the five freedoms and the health week campaign. They were primarily hung in clinic waiting rooms.</p>
