        <h3>DEFINE AND IDEATE</h3>
          <p>I took a new approach to designing this report. I wanted something that did not visually overwhelm you when you looked at it. I wanted something easy to read and easy to locate the information you wanted.</p>
          <p>I chose bright fun colours that made the report pop. I used a sans-serif font to keep the text easy to read and clean. There are large page number so the information you want can be easily located. Each section of the report is broken down into colour coordinated parts, that way you can go to the table of contents and know which colour section you want to be in.
  Each spread has an english page (left side) and a french page (right side) so the content is consistent and easy to follow along no matter what language you are reading it in.</p>
