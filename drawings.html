    <h3 itemprop="headline" class="push-1-2">What is Isometric?</h3>
    <p itemprop="text">Isometric illustrations are visual representations of three-dimensions in a 2D world. Rather than having lines lead to vanishing points, lines run parallel to one another. While the illustrations lack in perspective, they still project an illusion of depth by using colour tints, shades, and the cast shadows of various object within the scene.</p>

    <h3 itemprop="headline" class="push-1-2">Concept</h3>
    <p itemprop="description">As isometric illustrations often portray fun and whimsical themes, I chose demonstrate the process of building cat furniture featuring the builder’s themselves; tiny cats. I was inspired by scenes of construction sites, especially during lunch break, and the spirit of cats reputation for being playful, distracted and lazy.</p>
