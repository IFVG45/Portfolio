    <p itemprop="text">The Ottawa Hospital mHealth Lab, led by Dr. Kumanan Wilson, is a team of individuals who create innovative digital tools to improve healthcare. In other words, mHealth, which stands for mobile health, is the use of mobile phones, tablets, or other wireless devices in the practice of medicine or public health. Their goal is to encourage and empower individuals to manage their own health information and to help healthcare providers deliver better care. For this reason, mHealth Lab is developing practical and easy-to-use apps for people to manage their health information. The team has developed five mobile platforms and apps that are being used and help people connect with the larger healthcare system. These apps include CANImmunize, Project Big Life, The Ottawa Rules, RecoverNow, and OkKidney. </p>

    <p itemprop="text">The CANImmunize app allows Canadians to securely store and manage their family’s or their own immunization records digitally. The app is a bilingual tool that can be used on the smartphone anywhere you go. Not only does it store immunization records, it also reminds users of their appointments and includes reliable information and expert advice on immunization for children and adults. Another feature includes sending alerts about serious infectious disease outbreaks to protect users against them.

    <p itemprop="description">When parents see their children in dangerous situations, they try to prevent accidents from happening. Similar to immunizations, children can avoid illnesses by getting their vaccines. Therefore, the slogan: You wouldn't let them not wear a helmet. Keep them protected.</p>

        <h3>WHAT IS AN ISOMETRIC ILLUSTRATION?</h3>
        <p>Isometric illustrations are visual representations of three-dimensions in a 2D world. Rather than having lines lead to vanishing points, lines run parallel to one another. While the illustrations lack in perspective, they still project an illusion of depth by using colour tints, shades, and the cast shadows of various object within the scene.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-2 gutter">
        <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>Because of the lack of perspective (where objects further away from us visually appear smaller), it was initially a challenge to create depth to the scene. With the help of some strategically placed highlights, shadows, gradients and textures, the illustration was able to appear as if it existed physically in a three-dimensional space.</p>

        <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>
         <p>As isometric illustrations often portray fun and whimsical themes, I chose demonstrate the process of building cat furniture featuring the builder’s themselves; tiny cats. I was inspired by scenes of construction sites, especially during lunch break, and the spirit of cats reputation for being playful, distracted and lazy.</p>
