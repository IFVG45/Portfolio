    <h3 itemprop="headline" class="push-1-2">What is Isometric?</h3>
    <p itemprop="text">Isometric illustrations are visual representations of three-dimensions in a 2D world. Rather than having lines lead to vanishing points, lines run parallel to one another. While the illustrations lack in perspective, they still project an illusion of depth by using colour tints, shades, and the cast shadows of various object within the scene.</p>

    <h3 itemprop="headline" class="push-1-2">Concept</h3>
    <p itemprop="description">As isometric illustrations often portray fun and whimsical themes, I chose demonstrate the process of building cat furniture featuring the builder’s themselves; tiny cats. I was inspired by scenes of construction sites, especially during lunch break, and the spirit of cats reputation for being playful, distracted and lazy.</p>

        <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>The objective of this project was to create cohesive marketing materials (and fundraising merchandise) for the Canadian Veterinarian Medical Association's annual Animal Health Week. This year the theme was Animal Welfare: Safeguarding the Five Animal Freedoms.
         This project was completed during my contract with Simzer Design, the key Project Manger was Matt Melvin.

        <h3>DISCOVERY AND TARGET AUDIENCE RESEARCH</h3>
          <p>The first phase in this project was a multitude of pencil sketches for the primary illustrative logo. As CVMA treats a multitude of types of animals, representation was pivotal.</p>

      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-2 gutter">
        <h3>DEFINE AND IDEATE</h3>
          <p>Art direction for this project had to appeal to a wide audience, from veterinarians to their clients, both farm animal owners and pet families. For this reason, I went with a bright, bold and family-friendly approach. My concept comprises of 5 animals, representing the diversity of the veterinarians’ scope of care. Each animal in the logo corresponds to both a colour, and elsewhere in the campaign, one of the five freedoms.</p>
