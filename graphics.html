      <p>Using a realistic use-case scenario, a storyboard was created to illustrate how the app would be used in contextâ€”frustrated roommates discussing the fair distribution of chore responsibility.<br><br>Thorough market research on existing chore-organization apps was conducted to understand common features, as well as potential opportunities that may exist. User feedback of existing apps was collected to determine what worked well and what needed improvement.<br><br>It was determined that the app needed to be organized, motivating, customizable and fun to use. Users found it important to have their own user profile, and a running summary of their completed chores.</p>

      <h3>PROTOTYPING AND USABILITY TESTING</h3>
      <p>After creating a task flowchart, low fidelity paper prototypes were created and the app's UX was tested with peers. Main problems in the app flow, such as redundant screens or broken flows were identified and documented. Potential solutions were researched and implemented in a digital wireframe prototype.<br><br>Using <em>InVision</em>, the prototype was mocked up and tested in a second round of usability testing. From here, final problems and solutions were recorded and implemented.</p>

      <h3>USER INTERFACE DESIGN</h3>
      <p>To represent a fun and engaging theme, bright, energizing colours were chosen. Flat design illustration and ample white space makes the task at hand seem light, fun and easily accomplished.</p>
