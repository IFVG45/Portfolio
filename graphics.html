    <p itemprop="text">The Ottawa Hospital mHealth Lab, led by Dr. Kumanan Wilson, is a team of individuals who create innovative digital tools to improve healthcare. In other words, mHealth, which stands for mobile health, is the use of mobile phones, tablets, or other wireless devices in the practice of medicine or public health. Their goal is to encourage and empower individuals to manage their own health information and to help healthcare providers deliver better care. For this reason, mHealth Lab is developing practical and easy-to-use apps for people to manage their health information. The team has developed five mobile platforms and apps that are being used and help people connect with the larger healthcare system. These apps include CANImmunize, Project Big Life, The Ottawa Rules, RecoverNow, and OkKidney. </p>

    <h3 itemprop="headline" class="push-1-2">CANImmunize App</h3>
    <p itemprop="text">The CANImmunize app allows Canadians to securely store and manage their family’s or their own immunization records digitally. The app is a bilingual tool that can be used on the smartphone anywhere you go. Not only does it store immunization records, it also reminds users of their appointments and includes reliable information and expert advice on immunization for children and adults. Another feature includes sending alerts about serious infectious disease outbreaks to protect users against them. With this app, The Ottawa Hospital mHealth Research Team believe that is the best way for all Canadians to manage and keep record of their information.</p>
