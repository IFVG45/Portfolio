  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>My purpose was to create an traditional and authentic logo, making it friendly but yet combining personal connection with the client. My plan was to bring the original assets to the new logo. Keeping the same idea but a different look.</p>
   </div>
<div class="work-info wrapper">
  <h3>Challenge</h3>
  <p>The Maple Valley logo is very busy; with too many words, little imagery. With it’s bright yellow-orange colouring, at first glance, it could be mistaken for a bargain advertisement.</p>
</div>
<div class="work-info wrapper">
  <h3>Concept</h3>
  <p>I feel the overall look of the new logo is very unique and organic. It doesn’t only connect with them as the client but with their community as well. It brings a warm and homelike atmosphere.</p>
