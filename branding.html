      <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p> My purpose was to create an traditional and authentic logo, making it friendly but yet combining personal connection with the client. My plan was to bring the original assets to the new logo. Keeping the same idea but a different look.</p>

      <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
      <p>The Maple Valley logo is very busy; with too many words, little imagery. With it’s bright yellow-orange colouring, at first glance, it could be mistaken for a bargain advertisement.</p>

      <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>Research was conducted to thoroughly understand the demographics and psychographics of Beking’s target audience, as well as the family’s core values. Market competition of other small Ontario farms was also considered and analyzed to begin to conceptualize the Beking’s brand.<br><br>The resulting tone: “Beking’s Poulty Farm is humble, fresh, health-conscious, eco-friendly, convenient and cheerful.”</p>

      <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>
      <p>Initial inspirations and influences were found in earthy, tactile textures: weathered old wood grain, nests and hay bales. I envisioned the antique farm equipment and century old farmhouses that represented the strong family ties of tradition and farming history.<br><br>During the sketching and concept-development stages, distressed and vintage typefaces were explored for the word mark. Logo sketches featured the Beking’s product; eggs, as well as nests, chickens and quaint farm scenes. Attention was paid to ensure the elements represented a rustic, traditional, home-grown roots vibe that would best suit the brand.</p>

      <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
      <p>To represent the generations-old family farm theme, the typewriter-style typeface has a weathered, distressed appearance. An egg with the letter "B", for "Beking's" is centered within a textured nest, clearly representing the family's primary product; farm-fresh eggs.</p>
