      <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p> My purpose was to create an traditional and authentic logo, making it friendly but yet combining personal connection with the client. My plan was to bring the original assets to the new logo. Keeping the same idea but a different look.</p>

      <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
      <p>The Maple Valley logo is very busy; with too many words, little imagery. With it’s bright yellow-orange colouring, at first glance, it could be mistaken for a bargain advertisement.</p>

    <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-2 gutter">
      <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>Research was conducted to thoroughly understand the demographics and psychographics of The Maple Valley target audience, as well as the family’s core values. Market competition of other small Ontario tea was also considered and analyzed to begin to conceptualize the The Maple Valley’s brand.<br><br>The resulting tone: “Beking’s Poulty Farm is humble, fresh, health-conscious, eco-friendly, convenient and cheerful.”</p>

      <h3>CONCEPTS</h3>
      <p>I feel the overall look of the new logo is very unique and organic. It doesn’t only connect with them as the client but with
their community as well. It brings a warm and homelike atmosphere.
I decided that the maple leaf was the right choice for this, but I only used half of the leaf to tone it down. Keeping the design fairly simple, but with a modern look to it. Creating smooth curves between the leaves and the branch to create a elegant flow with the wordmark.

      <h3>FINAL DESIGN</h3>
      <p>For the wordmark, I made my own hand-lettering. I wanted to keep the home-like idea through the whole concept. The elegance of the curves made it connect well with the logo.
The colours were inspired by the fall leaves. Still keeping the connection with the client but also with the community. I also kept the relationship with the teas and the seasons, since their tea becomes more popular during the colder weather.
